## Introduction

Explain what our project is about:

We are doing our project on the realtion ship between batting average and home runs in the world series.

Present our two main questions:
We will look at how these two traditional statistics have changed, and which one is the biggest determinant 
for winning the World Series. 




## Historical Context

**World Series**

* Annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) 
  + *First played in 1903*
  + *Total of 117 played (Excepetions: 1904, 1994)*
  + *American League Champion vs. National League Champion*   
  + *Winner gets crowned WS champion and wins the Commissioner's Trophy*
  + *The best team in baseball for that season!*

## Variables 

* **Home Runs (HR)**  

  + **HR Def.** - *A home run occurs when a batter hits a fair ball and scores on the play without being put out or without the benefit                     of an error.*
  + **AKA** - *homer, dinger, blast, big fly, many more...*  
  
  
* **At-bats per HR (AB/HR)**  

  + **AB/HR Def.** - *A measure of how frequently a batter hits a home run.*
  + **Calculation** - *AB (At bats) / HR*
    + **Lower** AB/HR = **more** frequent HR
    + **Higher** AB/HR = **less** frequent HR  
    

* **Batting Average (AVG)**  

  + **AVG Def.** - *the average performance of a batter, expressed as a ratio of a batter's safe hits per official times at bat.*
  + **Calculation** - *Hits (H) / AB
    + **Lower** AVG = **less** frequent *H*
    + **Higher** AVG = **more** frequent *H*
  
  **NOTE:** Not all H are HR, but all HR are H

## **Relationship Between Variables**  

* **Home Runs v. Batting Average**  
  
    + **Traditional statistics**
      + *HR* - guarantees you score at least one run, or as many as four 
      + *AVG* - helps increase more scoring opportunities
    
    + **Players who hit:** 
      + more home runs have lower batting average  
      + less home runs have higher batting average

**So, is better to hit more homer runs, or hit for a higher batting aveage to win the World Series?**

## Data Used
The data used comes from the 'Lahman' baseball database. The Lahman Database was created by Sean Lahman; an investigative journalist for the USA Today Network, sports columnist for the New York Sun, and data projects manager for the Society of American Baseball Research. Lahman has also served as editor and contributor in several sports reference books.
   
For the purposes of this project we will be utilizing the 'BattingPost' table which includes individual player batting statistics for each different MLB postseason round from 1903 through 2020.

The 'BattingPost' table contains a total of  15,460 unique observations. Each observation contains data that pertains to 22 different variables

```{r}
as_tibble(view(BattingPost))

```

The 'SeriesPost' table contains a total of 358 unique observations. Each observation contains data that pertains to 9 different variables. This table tells us the winning and losing teams for each postseaon round from 1884-2020, as well has what leagues they belonged to, and how many games they won/lost. 

```{r}

as_tibble(view(SeriesPost))

```

## Data Cleaning/Tidying
We only want to look at World Series 'WS' batting info from 1922-2020. The WS was first played in 1903 but didn't become a best of seven games series until 1922. Let's also remove the 'playerID' column as we will not need to know any individual player's name.
```{r, echo=FALSE, results=TRUE}
WS_Batting <- BattingPost %>%
  filter(round == "WS", 
         yearID >= 1922 & yearID <= 2020) %>%
  select(yearID, round, teamID, G, AB, H, HR)

```

## Results

Summary of trends. What can we expect to see in future World Series'?

Can we determine if hitting more home runs or hitting for a higher batting
average is more condusive to winning the World Series? Why or why not?


## Conclusion

Nice goodbye, and thanks.
